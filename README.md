## Wireframes 

The site was designed with a mobile-first approach.

The same design was used for mobile, tablet and desktop to ensure consistancy for the user. The only difference being the layout and responsive design when switching from each device size. 

My wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) and can be viewed [here]
